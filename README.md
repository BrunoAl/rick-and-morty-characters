# Rick and morty case

## Instruction

```sh
    to run the project: yarn && yarn start
    to run the tests: yarn test
    deployed version: https://zen-jones-533c85.netlify.app/
```

## What would I change if had more time

- Create a better UI for the form to search the characters, maybe a tab component to render which one separately.
- Mock every API call and build integration tests to handle the search forms and characters list.
- Paginate the character list.
- There's not enough contrast between the colors, since this is a important for a11y, I would have chosen different colors for a production website
